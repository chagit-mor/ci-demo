Profile
I’m a practical Python developer with 3+ years’ experience working with systems that integrate hardware and software. I focus on AI performance benchmarking and test automation, and I typically take ownership of tasks from research and prototyping through deployment and tuning. I enjoy digging into performance bottlenecks and turning experiments into repeatable tools.

Key Skills
Tech stack: Python, C, C#, Flask, Dash (Plotly), Pandas, NumPy, Pytest, Matplotlib  
Databases & tools: SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Git, GitLab, Gerrit, Jira  
DevOps & CI: Docker, Jenkins, CI/CD pipelines  
Platforms: Linux, Windows  
Domains: AI/ML performance benchmarking, chip validation, CAN/UDS hardware validation, embedded systems testing, big‑data analytics

Professional Experience

NeuReality — Validation & Performance Engineer (AI Systems)  
01 Feb 2025 – 06 Jul 2025  
NeuReality develops hardware and software platforms for large‑scale AI inference acceleration.  
- Performed benchmarking and optimization of LLMs on NR1 hardware; tuned runtime parameters (batch size, parallelism, quantization and runtime libraries) to improve throughput and efficiency.  
- Built a Docker environment for running benchmarks: created container templates and orchestration scripts, set CPU pinning and NUMA settings, mounted datasets and collected logs into our database for reporting.  
- Configured Jenkins pipelines to schedule and run benchmark jobs automatically, manage versions and surface failures to the team.  
- Developed Python scripts for validation, benchmarking and automated analysis; implemented result ingestion to the internal DB and created Power BI dashboards for tracking and comparisons.  
- Ran cross‑platform comparisons (GPU, x86, NR1) and analyzed throughput (TPS), latency and memory usage; investigated prefill/decode stages and KV cache behavior for compressed models.  
Achievement: Delivered measurable improvements in LLM inference throughput through runtime/configuration tuning and automation.  
Technologies: Python, Linux, Docker, Jenkins, Power BI, CI/CD

Innoviz Technologies — Python, Embedded & Full‑Stack Developer  
2022 – 2025  
Innoviz develops LiDAR sensors and perception software for autonomous vehicles, supplying sensing and perception solutions used in ADAS and autonomous driving platforms.  
- Designed and implemented server‑side components for a data management platform for vehicle recordings (analytics, labeling, optimization).  
- Built and maintained backend services (ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, MySQL) and supported frontend components (React) used for dashboards and tooling.  
- Developed point‑cloud analytics tools with Python, Dash (Plotly) and Pandas; optimized data access and processing pipelines.  
- Improved data processing performance by parallelizing Python workloads and optimizing data flows and I/O.  
- Designed and developed an end‑to‑end automated hardware validation infrastructure: implemented low‑level CAN and UDS connectivity, developed Python communication libraries, created test framework classes and orchestrators, and centralized result collection for reporting and analysis.  
- Developed automated tests for embedded C code (test design and automation) and executed them in the CANTATA environment.  
- Implemented HighProtectLayer — a Python layer that secures hardware API requests.  
Technologies: Python, C, React, ASP.NET Core, MySQL, Pandas, Dash (Plotly), Docker, CANTATA
